# **Project Plan -- Team 26

##1 Introduction

```The introduction provides context for the project. Write a concise description of the software you will develop and its target users.```

We will developing an application named "AverageSentenceLength" for students in a university. The program is Java based and executable from command line. This program will take a ASCII text file as input and will output the average number of words in every sentence within the file. 

##2 Process Description

```Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:```

```- Activity name (verb or verb phrase)```
```- Activity description (concise paragraph)```
```- Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)```
```- Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)```

Our team are using a waterfall-like process for this project. Specifically, we will implement the following steps:

**Plan Project:** Several meeting are scheduled to build the team, outline the whole process and define various responsibilities. A project plan will be drafted by the project manager and approved by the team.

**Define requirements: **The user requirements and system requirements(functional and non-functional) are identified in this step. The documentation lead will write the documents and update it after team review.

**Develop software: **The software will be developed through Java. The code will be shared and managed using Github repository. The code should be tested by QA manager and reviewed by all team members until it meets the requirements according to the requirements document.

**Verify software: **The software will be tested through various cases using JUnit. The QA manager will prepare test cases which are raw text files including different delimeters to verify each functions and work with the develop lead to fix problems and make sure it pass all the tests.

**Write user manual: **As a user guide, the manual will be written and released with the software. It will contain both usage guide and troubleshooting information for the software. The content will be written by the documentation and reviewed by all team members.


##3 Team

```Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)```

```- Team members' names```
```- Roles, with a short description of each role```
```- Table showing which team member(s) has which role(s)```

Our team includes four members. The following are roles and their responsibilities:

###Project manager (Yuchun Qin)
The project manager are responsible for setting goals and tracking the whole progress. This role drafts the project plan. 

###Development lead (Cedric Meury)
The development lead writes the Java code for the Java Application, and manages merges of different branches.

###Documentation lead (ganesh.shivashankar)
The documentation lead manages the documentation systems and writes the requirements document and user manual.

###QA manager (Yue Li)
The QA manager will prepare test cases and write Junit code to tests/debugs the code and evaluates the quality of the application to meet all requirements.


##4 Estimates

```Provide estimates for the following metrics:```

```- Effort hours: total number of team-member hours you expect to spend on the project```
```- Lines of code: total number of lines of source code you expect to have in your final product```

We expect that this project should take a combined 25 team-member hours. In the final product, we expect 100 lines of code for the software, and 50 lines of code for testing.

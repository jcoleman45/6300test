# **Project Plan -- Team 26

##1 Introduction

```The introduction provides context for the project. Write a concise description of the software you will develop and its target users.```

Development of a tool named "Average Sentence Length" for use by students in a university. Typically the students in the University write essays which have long and very wordy sentences. This tool would help the students improve their writing style by helping them count the average number of words in the sentences of their essays.

The application will be a Java language based executable that can be run from the command prompt. The application will take an ASCII text file that contains the essay as input and will output the average number of words of all sentences within that file (for the particular essay). 

##2 Process Description

```Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:```

```- Activity name (verb or verb phrase)```
```- Activity description (concise paragraph)```
```- Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)```
```- Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)```

The software development methodology planned to be used is the waterfall-process. Specifically, the following activities are planned : 

**Plan Project:** Meetings are scheduled to build the team, outline the whole process and define individual and team responsibilities. A project plan (current document) will be drafted by the project manager and approved by the team. The project plan will be tracked on an ongoing basis until the completion of the project. Certain PM metrics will be captured as and when necessary.

Entry Criteria

Exit Criteria


**Define Requirements:** The user requirements and system requirements(functional and non-functional) will be identified. The Documentation lead will be responsible for the overall documentation with support from all team members with respect to review.

Entry Criteria

Exit Criteria

**Develop Software:** The software will be developed using Java. The code will be shared and managed using Github version control repository. The code shall be tested by QA manager with support from all team members until it meets the requirements as per the requirements document.

Entry Criteria

Exit Criteria

**Verify software:** The software will be tested through various test cases written using JUnit tool. The QA manager will prepare test scenarios and test cases along with test input data like raw text files that contains the essays. This will include various input combinations like different delimiters etc... to verify each functionality. The QA manager will work with the development lead to fix problems and make sure all tests are passed. The test cases will be written to have good code coverage.

Entry Criteria

Exit Criteria

**Write User Manual:** Detailed user guides will be documented and released with the software. It will contain both usage guide and troubleshooting information for the software. The content will be written by the documentation lead and reviewed by all team members.

##3 Team

```Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)```

```- Team members' names```
```- Roles, with a short description of each role```
```- Table showing which team member(s) has which role(s)```

Project team structure is given below along with their roles and responsibilities:

###Project manager (Yuchun Qin)
The project manager are responsible for setting goals and tracking the whole progress. This role drafts the project plan. 

###Development lead (Cedric Meury)
The development lead writes the Java code for the Java Application, and manages merges of different branches.

###Documentation lead (ganesh.shivashankar)
The documentation lead manages the documentation systems and writes the requirements document and user manual.

###QA manager (Yue Li)
The QA manager will prepare test cases and write Junit code to tests/debugs the code and evaluates the quality of the application to meet all requirements.


##4 Estimates

```Provide estimates for the following metrics:```

```- Effort hours: total number of team-member hours you expect to spend on the project```
```- Lines of code: total number of lines of source code you expect to have in your final product```

We expect that this project should take a combined 25 team-member hours. In the final product, we expect 100 lines of code for the software, and 50 lines of code for testing.

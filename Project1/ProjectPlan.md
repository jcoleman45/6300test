# **Project Plan -- Team 26**

##1 Introduction

The project involves development of an application called "Average Sentence Length" for use by students in a university.
Typically the students in the University write essays which have long and very wordy sentences. This tool would help the
students improve their writing style by helping them count the average number of words in the sentences of their essays.

The application will be written in Java, the executable will be run from the command prompt. The application will
take a raw text file as input, parse all sentences of the essay and output the average number of words per sentence. 

##2 Process Description

The software development methodology used for this project is the waterfall process. Specifically, the following
activities are planned for the complete execution of this project. Activity 2.5 "Write User Manual" will be tackled on a
continuous basis while the other steps are being executed sequentially.

###2.1 Plan Project
This phase includes the overall planning of activities for the whole project such as regular project meetings to build 
the team and to get the activity updates, outline the whole process and define individual and team responsibilities.
A project plan (current document) will be drafted by the project manager and approved by the team. The project plan will 
be tracked on an ongoing basis until the completion of the project. Metrics will be captured as and when necessary.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Request for creation of a software application for use by university students
- Set of team members
- Instructor notes on specific deliverables required for the assignment (plan, requirements, design, code,
documentation)

**Exit Criteria**

- Finalized Project Plan document
- Agreed project roles for the individuals
- Agreed project execution methodology
- Agreed timelines for the execution of various activities
- Project plan to be uploaded to github repository

###2.2 Define Requirements
The user requirements and system requirements will be identified during this phase. The
Documentation lead will be responsible for the overall documentation with support from all team members with respect to
review.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan
- Verbal requirements as specified in the conversation videos
- Instructor notes regarding requirements

**Exit Criteria**

- Detailed requirements specification (functional and non-functional)
- Requirements document review and approval by all team members
- Questions about the requirements to be posted to Laura
- Requirements specification document to be uploaded to Github repository

###2.3 Develop Software
The software will be developed using Java technology. The code will be shared and managed using Github version control 
repository. Intermediate code reviews will be performed before testing. The code shall be unit-tested by all development
team members.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan
- Software requirements specification

**Exit Criteria**

- Agreed design and source code for the application including test cases
- Approval of development completion by development lead
- Unit testing coverage of 60% or above
- Working source code and unit tests shall be uploaded to Github repository

###2.4 Verify software
The software will be tested through various test cases using manual and automated testing. The QA manager
will prepare test scenarios and test cases along with test input data like raw text files that contains the essays. This 
will include various input combinations (e.g. different delimiters) to verify each functionality. The QA manager
will work with the development lead to fix defects and make sure all tests are passed. The code coverage details will 
also be validated. The defects will be categorized in severity with critical/major/minor.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan
- Software requirements specification
- Application and Unit-Tests source code

**Exit Criteria**

- Agreed test cases (integration, system, unit etc...) that test each requirement. 
- Sample test data preparation and agreement by the QA manager
- Test completion details
- Approval of test completion by QA manager
- No critical/major/minor defects
- All artifacts will be uploaded to Github repository

###2.5 Write User Manual
Detailed user guides will be documented and released with the software. It will contain both usage guide and 
troubleshooting information for the software. The content will be written by the documentation lead and reviewed by 
all team members.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan
- Requirements specification
- Test Cases
- Tested application

**Exit Criteria**

- User manual document
- Review and agreement of user manual by all team members
- Approval from documentation lead
- All artifacts will be uploaded to Github repository

##3 Team

The project team constitutes of the following members:

- Yuchun Qin
- Cedric Meury
- Yue Li
- Ganesh Shivashankaraiah

The description of roles assigned to team members are given below:

- **Project Manager:** The project manager is responsible for setting goals and tracking the whole progress. This role drafts the project
plan.
- **Development Lead:** The development lead writes the Java code for the Java application, and manages merges of different branches in 
the github repository.
- **Documentation Lead:** The documentation lead manages the various documents and writes the requirements document, user manual etc...
- **QA Manager:** The QA manager will prepare test cases and write  code to test/debug the code and evaluates the quality of the
application to meet all requirements.

In this project, the roles are assigned as follows:

| Team Member             | Role(s)                        |

| Ganesh Shivashankaraiah | Documentation Lead, Developer  |

##4 Estimates

**Effort Hours**

- The estimated project effort should be around 40 person-hours. 

**Lines of Code**

- The estimated amount of LOC for the finished application is around 200 lines, and an additional 200 lines for unit
tests.

# Vision Document

*This is the template for your vision document, adapted from a [template provided by StartupCTO](http://www.startupcto.com/templates/software-vision-document-template). You can refer to their document for additional details and examples.) Your final document should be a couple of pages long. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

**Author**: \<person or team name\>

## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean 	and simple, one or two sentences at most.*

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

*Here you discuss the reason you are planning to build your product. Youâ€™ll want to talk about the problem people are facing, the requirements you need to meet to solve that problem (10000-foot view), and the market itself. Essentially, youâ€™re making a case that the product needs to be built.*

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

*Here you talk about the product itself. Give a high level overview of the solution and how it meets the needs outlined above. Optionally, you can talk about plans for both this version and future versions.*

## 4 Major Features (Optional)

*Here you outline the features at a high level (a detailed feature outline belongs in the requirements document.) Some people prefer to outline features in the above Product/Solution Overview section, which is also a fine approach. Whatever you do, keep it to bullet points, not paragraphs. If you can use pictures, such as mockups, even better.*

## 5 Scope and Limitations

*The Scope and Limitations section is where you talk about what is, and in particular, what is not included. This is where you tactfully tell your boss that his pet feature is not going to be included.*

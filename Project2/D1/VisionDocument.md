# Vision Document

## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean 	and simple, one or two sentences at most.*

Payment and rewards management system (PReSM) is an Android application that will allow the two farmers of a mobile stall
to manage payment and rewards for their customs. The PReSM can be used on their Android devices to edit customers,
process payments, track transaction history, and send reward emails.

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

*Here you discuss the reason you are planning to build your product. You'll want to talk about the problem people
are facing, the requirements you need to meet to solve that problem (10000-foot view), and the market itself.
Essentially, you're making a case that the product needs to be built.*

Brad and Janet, two young farmers from the Atlanta area who sell their produce regularly at local farmers markets.
Currently, they have no effective system to manage payment and reward their customers. To simplify the payment process
and keep royal customers, they need a Payment and rewards management system to handle these problems quickly and easily.
In addition, this system should be run on the Android OS for convenience.

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

*Here you talk about the product itself. Give a high level overview of the solution and how it meets the needs outlined
above. Optionally, you can talk about plans for both this version and future versions.*

PReSM is an application which can be used on any Android device. It integrates with other Android utility
components (credit-card scanning, payment processing, and email management) to offer payment and rewards management
features.

The application will store customer information and track transactions to help the stall managers reward their royal
customers. The application shall interact with credit-card scanner hardware and a payment processing provider to 
perform transactions. At the same time, the application shall integrate with an email-service to notify customers when 
they get a reward or discount.

## 4 Major Features (Optional)

*Here you outline the features at a high level (a detailed feature outline belongs in the requirements document.) Some
people prefer to outline features in the above Product/Solution Overview section, which is also a fine approach.
Whatever you do, keep it to bullet points, not paragraphs. If you can use pictures, such as mockups, even better.*

The following are the major features that the MReMs will be able to provide:

4.1 The stall managers will be able to add/edit customer accounts in the system.

4.2 The stall managers will be able to process payment through this system.

4.3 System is capable to read credit card information through credit card scanner.

4.8 The system is capable to update customer status and their transaction history.

## 5 Scope and Limitations

*The Scope and Limitations section is where you talk about what is, and in particular, what is not included. This is 
where you tactfully tell your boss that his pet feature is not going to be included.*

5.1 The PReMS is designed for two mobile stall owners to manage payment and rewards for their business in a local farmer
market. It is not open to the public including  customers.

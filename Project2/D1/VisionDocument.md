## 1 Introduction

Payment and rewards management system (PReMS) is an Android application that will allow the two farmers of a mobile stall
to manage payment and rewards for their customers. The PReMS can be used on their Android devices to add/edit customers,
process payments, track transaction history, and send rewards' related emails.

## 2 Business Needs / Requirements

Brad and Janet are two young farmers from the Atlanta area who sell their produce regularly at local farmers markets.
Currently, they have no effective system to manage payments and reward their loyal customers. A full-fledged Payments
processing system from a big vendor will be very expensive and would require expense infrastructure and maintenance cost
as well.
To simplify the payment process using a low cost application and keep loyal customers, they need a Payment and rewards 
management system to handle these problems quickly and easily. Hence the PReSM system will be built to run on the Android 
Mobile OS for convenience and conciseness.

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

PReMS is an application which can be used on any Android device (preferably mobile phones). It integrates with other Android utility components (credit-card scanning, payment processing, and email management) to offer payment and rewards management
features.

The application will store customer information and track transactions to help the stall managers reward their royal
customers. The application shall interact with credit-card scanner hardware and a payment processing provider to 
perform transactions. At the same time, the application will integrate with an email-service to notify customers when 
they get a reward or discount.

For future versions, the applicaton will probably be ported to other mobile OSes so that it can be used by multiple 
retailers. There is also a thought of increasing the type of rewards by adding coupons etc...

## 4 Major Features (Optional)



The following are the major features that the PReMS will be able to provide:

4.1 The stall managers will be able to add/edit customer accounts in the system.

4.2 The stall managers will be able to process payment through this system.

4.3 System is capable to read credit card information through credit card scanner.

4.4 The system's hardware is capable to connect with a payment-processing service provider.

4.5 The stall managers will be able to check the transaction history in detail.

4.6 The system is capable of computing the final payment after applying discounts/rewards.

4.7 The system is capable of sending emails to customers when they reach min-purchase for gold status or for 10-dollar 
rewards.

4.8 The system is capable of updating customer status and their transaction history.

## 5 Scope and Limitations

5.1 The PReMS is designed for two mobile stall owners to manage payment and rewards for their business in a local farmer
market. It is not open to the public including customers.

5.2 The PReMS is only designed to work on Android OS device with Internet access. It won't work on any other systems
such as iPhone.

5.3 The PReMS only accepts payment by Credit card. It won't work with other payment methods such as cash.

5.4 PReMS will not use the previously used Credit card (stored in transaction history) for new transactions. Each time,
the credit card has to be scanned even if it is the same credit card. This is done to enhance security.

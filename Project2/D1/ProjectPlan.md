# Project Plan

*This is the template for your project plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.*

**Author**: \<Team26\>

## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*
We will be producing an Android mobile application for Payment and Rewards Management System (PReMS) for a Mobile stall at local farmers markets in the Atlanta area. The application will allow two young famers (Brad and Janet) to manage payment and reward their royal customers.


## 2 Process Description

*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*

The PReMS will be implemented using the UML based Process which will consist of 3 phases and multiple iterations throughout the application’s design. There will be a set of documents and activities that are produced as part of this process. The description of these documents and activities generated in each of the phases are listed throughout this section.

###2.1 Inception and Elaboration (week1)
This phase includes the overall planning of activities for the whole project, outline the whole process and define individual and team responsibilities.
####2.11 Project Plan (current document) 
A project plan will be drafted by the project manager and approved by the team. The project plan will be tracked on an ongoing basis until the completion of the project. Metrics will be captured as and when necessary.
####2.12 Vision Document 
The vision document will outline the business needs, requirements, production, solution, major features, scope, accessibility and limitation of the PReMS.
####2.13 Use Case Model
The use case model contain a use case diagram with descriptions to depict all the actors and use cases for the system. The use cases should explain how various actors interact in the system and what the outcome is. This part may include multiple scenarios, for normal, alternate, and exceptional event sequences.  
####2.14 Supplementary Requirements
This document will outline the various non­-functional requirements that do not fit the use-case model.
####2.15 Design Document
This document will outline all design considerations, assumptions, constraints and system environment. It will also depict the system operation through high-level and low-level design. The internal structure of the software component would be expressed as a UML class diagram we developed in Deliverable 0.
####2.16 Test plan(without results)
This document will provide a concise description of how to test the system. The test techniques and test levels will be defined. A table of test cases should be provided for the main functional that the application must satisfy. Each test case will contain the description of how to run it, what inputs to provide, and its expected output. The result of the test cases will not be presented in this phase.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Request for creation of an Android application for a Mobile stall at local farmers markets

- Set of team members

- Instructor notes on specific deliverables required for the assignment (plan, requirements, design, code, documentation)

**Exit Criteria**

- Finalized project plan, vision document, use case model, supplementary requirements,design document and test plan

- Agreed project roles for the individuals

- Agreed project execution methodology

- Agreed timelines for the execution of various phases

- All documents to be uploaded to Github repository

###2.2 Construction(week2)
####2.21 Revise Earlier Documents
The initial project plan, vision document, supplementary requirements,design document and test plan may be revised as needed.
####2.22 Traceability Information
The traceability information will use a table to map the flow from use cases to the design elements,the corresponding code and the tests.
####2.23 Develop Initial Version App
The initial version of the application will be developed according to the previous documents(design document,use case model etc...)
####2.24 Complete Test Plan With Results
The application will be tested in this step and the results will be documented. The test cases should adequately cover the functionality of the application. The QA manager will work with the development lead to fix defects and make sure all tests are passed. The code coverage details will also be validated. The test result will be added in Test Plan document.
####2.25 User manual
Detailed user guides will be documented and released with the software. It will contain both usage guide and troubleshooting information for the software. The content will be written by the documentation lead and reviewed by all team members.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project plan, vision document, use case model, supplementary requirements,design document, test plan(without result)

- Software requirements specification

**Exit Criteria**

- Documents reviewed by all team members

- Agreed design and source code for the application including test cases

- Finalized user manual

- Finalized test plan with results

- All artifacts to be uploaded to Github repository

###2.3 Transition(week3)
####2.31 Revise Earlier Documents
In this phase, the team will go over all the documents throughout the whole project and make any final changes. 
####2.32 Release Final Version App
The Beta version of the application will be reviewed and revised (if necessary) to meet all requirements. 
A final commit id will be submitted to T­-Square by the project manager.

**Entrance Criteria**
- Project plan, vision document, use case model, supplementary requirements,design document, test plan and user manual

- Software requirements specification

- Application and test source code

**Exit Criteria**
- Agreed the final version application

- Agreed test cases (integration, system, unit etc...) that test each requirement

- Approval of all documents

- No critical/major/minor defects

- All artifacts to be uploaded to Github repository

## 3 Team

*Describe the team and their roles (there may be more roles than there are team members)*

- *Team members' names*
- *Roles, with a short description of each role*
- *Table showing which team member(s) has which role(s)*
The project team constitutes of the following members:

- Yuchun Qin
- Cedric Meury
- Yue Li
- Ganesh Shivashankaraiah

The description of roles assigned to team members are given below:

- **Project Manager:** The project manager is responsible for setting goals and tracking the whole progress. This role drafts the project plan,user case model etc...
- **Development Lead:** The development lead writes the code for the Android application, and manages merges of different branches in the Github repository. 
- **Documentation Lead:** The documentation lead manages the various documents and writes the supplementary document, user manual etc...
- **QA Manager:** The QA manager will prepare test cases and write code to test/debug the code and evaluates the quality of the application to meet all requirements.This role will draft the test plan.

In this project, the roles are assigned as follows:

| Team Member             | Role(s)                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Yuchun Qin              | Project Manager, Documentation |
| Cedric Meury            | Development Lead, Developer    |
| Yue Li                  | QA Manager, Tester, Developer  |
| Ganesh Shivashankaraiah | Documentation Lead, Developer  |

Every member is expected to review documents and codes on Github as needed.
## 4 Estimates

*Provide estimates for the following metrics:*

- *Effort hours: total number of team-member hours you expect to spend on the project*
- *Lines of code: total number of lines of source code you expect to have in your final product*

**Effort Hours**

- The estimated project effort should be around 100 person-hours. 

**Lines of Code**

- The estimated amount of LOC for the finished application is around 1000 lines, and an additional 400 lines for 
tests.
